Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), I am driven by the desire to create something meaningful—work that helps others and brings value to the table. My passion lies in bridging the gap between development and operations, and I am actively learning the tools and technologies that define the DevOps space.

With skills in website and software development, I’m continuously expanding my knowledge in:

Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines
Kubernetes for container orchestration
Puppet & Ansible for automation
Python & Linux for scripting and system management
And more to come...

Beyond tech, I keep stress at bay through music, gaming, and refreshing walks. Every day is a step toward becoming a well-rounded DevOps professional, ready to innovate and contribute.
